# COMMON PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

## Variables and Mutability

- By default, variables are immutable in Rust. Once  a variable is tied to a name, you cant change that value.
- You dont have to keep an eye on where and how the value might change.
- In cases where you are using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances.

### Differences Between Variables and Constants
- Immutable variables might have reminded you of `constants` in C
- Constants are not just immutable by default. They are forever immutable.
- Constants are only set to constant expression (e.g. Physics constants) - not to the result of a function.
- Rust's convention for naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with underscores in between words.


### Shadowing
- When you declare a new variable with the same name as the previous.
```Rust
fn main(){
    let x = 3;
    let x = x*2;
    println!("The current x = {}", x);
}
```
- This is similar to overwriting.
- It is different from making the variable `mut`.
