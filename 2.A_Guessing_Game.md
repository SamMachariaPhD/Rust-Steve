# PROGRAMMING A GUESSING GAME

# TO DO:
- let
- match
- methods
- associated fuctions
- using external crates

## Setting up a new project
`$ cargo new guessing_game` <br>
`$ cd guessing_game`

## Getting a guess from the user
* To deal with inputs and outputs, you must include the standard input-output libary `use std::io;`.
* If you have to use any other feature that is not included in the prelude by default, you need to use `use`, similar to `# include` in `C/C++`.
* To store values from the user, we have to prepare a mutable place/space.
* `let` statement is used to create a variable. e.g. `let x = 2;`
* In Rust, variables are immutable by default. If you want them mutable, you must specify that explicitly using `mut` keyword. e.g. `let mut x = 2;`
