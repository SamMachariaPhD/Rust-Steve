# COMMON PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

## Variables and Mutability

- By default, variables are immutable in Rust. Once  a variable is tied to a name, you cant change that value.
- You dont have to keep an eye on where and how the value might change.
- In cases where you are using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances.
