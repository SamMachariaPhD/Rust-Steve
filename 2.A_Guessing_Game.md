# PROGRAMMING A GUESSING GAME

# TO DO:
- let
- match
- methods
- associated fuctions
- using external crates

## Setting up a new project
`$ cargo new guessing_game` <br>
`$ cd guessing_game`

## Getting a guess from the user
* To deal with inputs and outputs, you must include the standard input-output libary `use std::io;`.
* If you have to use any other feature that is not included in the prelude by default, you need to use `use`, similar to `# include` in `C/C++`.
* To store values from the user, we have to prepare a mutable place/space.
* `let` statement is used to create a variable. e.g. `let x = 2;`
* In Rust, variables are immutable by default. If you want them mutable, you must specify that explicitly using `mut` keyword. e.g. `let mut x = 2;`
* `String::new` is a function that returns a new instance of a `String`.
* `String` is a type provided by the standard library and it is growable.
* `::` in `::new` indicates that `new` is the associated function of the `String` type. 
* `new` function creates a new empty string. A common name for a fuction that makes a new value of some kind.
* `let mut guess = String::new()` - create a mutable variable tied to a new empty instance of a string.
* In `std::io::stdin`, `stdin` function returns an instance `std::io::Stdin` which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.
* `.read_line(&mut guess)`, calls `read_line` method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.
