# PROGRAMMING A GUESSING GAME

# TO DO:
- let
- match
- methods
- associated fuctions
- using external crates

## Setting up a new project
`$ cargo new guessing_game` <br>
`$ cd guessing_game`

## Getting a guess from the user
* To deal with inputs and outputs, you must include the standard input-output libary `use std::io;`.
* If you have to use any other feature that is not included in the prelude by default, you need to use `use`, similar to `# include` in `C/C++`.
* To store values from the user, we have to prepare a mutable place/space.
* `let` statement is used to create a variable. e.g. `let x = 2;`
* In Rust, variables are immutable by default. If you want them mutable, you must specify that explicitly using `mut` keyword. e.g. `let mut x = 2;`
* `String::new` is a function that returns a new instance of a `String`.
* `String` is a type provided by the standard library and it is growable.
* `::` in `::new` indicates that `new` is the associated function of the `String` type. 
* `new` function creates a new empty string. A common name for a fuction that makes a new value of some kind.
* `let mut guess = String::new()` - create a mutable variable tied to a new empty instance of a string.
* In `std::io::stdin`, `stdin` function returns an instance `std::io::Stdin` which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.
* `.read_line(&mut guess)`, calls `read_line` method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.
* `read_line` takes whatever the user inputs and places that into a string. The string has to be mutable for this method to work.
* `&` indicates that the argument is a *reference*. This lets multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without having to copy. A powerful feature in Rust.
* `&mut guess` (not just `&guess`) to make it mutable.
* After reading the user input, this line also returns the results `io::Result`
* The status of `io::Result` is either `Ok` or `Err`
* The `expect` method comes in handy when the `io::Result` status is `Err`. It will cause the program to stop and display the message that you passed.
* If you dont call `expect`, the program will run but you'll get a warning.
* `{}` is a placeholder for the value to be printed - like little crab pincers holding some prey. <br>
```Rust
let x = 3;
let y = 7;
println!("X = {} and Y = {}", x,y);
\\ X = 3 and Y = 7
```

## Generating a Secret Number
* Rust does not include random number function in its standard library. However, a `rand` crate exists [https://crates.io/crates/rand/].
* This `rand` crate is a binary crate for use in various programs.
* Before using this external crate, `Cargo.toml` must be modified to include the rand crate as a dependency. <br>
```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.3.14"
```
* `0.3.14` is a shorthand for `^0.3.14` which means - any version that has a public API compatible with version `0.3.14`.
* Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything from the `registry` which is a copy of data from crates, a place where Rust developers post their open source projects.
* `rand` depends on `libc` to work.
* If you dont change anything in your code, `cargo build` will just output `Finished`. It is as sensitive as `git`.
* Thanks to semantic versioning, `SemVer`, you may see different version numbers after doing `cargo build`. But they are all compatible with the code.

### Ensuring reproducible builds with the cargo.lock file
* The `cargo.lock` file ensures that you always build your project with the versions you started working with unless you explicitly specify otherwise in `cargo.toml`.
* This guarantees reproducibility by ensuring that your program will always build with the original versions, no matter the current updates.
* If you use the `update` command, `cargo.lock` will be ignored and the latest version in a release that works will be writen to `cargo.toml`
* Generally cargo makes it easy to use libraries reliably.

## Generating a random number
* `Rng` in `use::rand::Rng` is a trait that defines methods that random number generators implement.
* `rand::thread_rng` gives us the particular random number generator that we are going to use.
* Documentation for a crate will always be necessary. Use `cargo doc --open` to view documentation
