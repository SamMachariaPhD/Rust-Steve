# GETTING STARTED

## TO DO:
- Installing Rust on Linux
- Writing a `Hello , World!`
- Using `cargo`

## Installing Rust on Linux

* Rust stability ensures that the old code will continue to compile in future. Forward compatibility?
* To install rust, <br>
`$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` <br>
* You will get a message in the terminal, `Rust is installed now. Great!` 
* Restart the terminal and then <br>
`$ source $HOME/.cargo/env`

## Writing Hello World
```rust
fn main()
{
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
<br>
* The `main()` function is always the first code that runs first in Rust.
* `println!` calls a Rust macro. Just `println` would be called a function. More on this later.
* If you give anyone the rust compiled file, they do not need to have Rust installed in their system for the code to run.

## Using the `Cargo` tool
* Sharing the compiled code is good enough to execute anywhere but as your project expands, you'll need better management.
* Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.
* Cargo comes installed with Rust. `$ cargo --version`
* To get started with Cargo, <br>
`$ cargo new hello_cargo` <br>
* Make sure all the instructions and the readme are outside the `src` directory i.e. like or in the `cargo.toml`file.
* To build a cargo project, go inside the cargo folder and do: <br>
`$ cargo build` <br>
* `cargo.lock` keeps track of the exact versions of the dependencies in your project.
* You may use `$ cargo run` to compile the code and then run the resulting executable all in one command.
* `cargo check` quickly checks your code to make sure that it compiles but it does not produce an executable. It'S much faster than `cargo build`
* When your program is ready for release, use `cargo build --release`
* With strictly simple projects, `Cargo` does not provide a lot of value over just usign `rustc`
